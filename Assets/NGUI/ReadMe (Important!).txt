If you are importing examples, since Unity project settings don't seem to get included in the package, you have to
do either of the two steps in order to get some examples to work properly:

1. If it's a clean project, simply extract the contents of the LibraryAssets.zip file
   into the Library folder (Unity 3.4) or the ProjectSettings folder (Unity 3.5+), overwriting what's there.
2. Alternatively, or if it's an existing project, add 2 new layers: "2D UI" and "3D UI", without quotes.
   Not sure how? Select any game object, top right has a drop-down called "Layer", and it's likely set to
   "Default". Expand it, click "Add Layer", and add the 2 layers by typing them in the User Layer 8 and 9 fields.
   
If you are not importing examples, you can ignore this part.
