****** !!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!! ******

Since Unity project settings don't seem to get included in the package, you have to
do either of the two steps in order to get some examples to work properly:

1. If it's a clean project, simply extract the contents of the LibraryAssets.zip file
   into the Library folder, overwriting what's there.
2. Alternatively, or if it's an existing project, add 2 new layers: "2D UI" and "3D UI", without quotes.
   Not sure how? Select any game object, top right has a drop-down called "Layer", and it's likely set to
   "Default". Expand it, click "Add Layer", and add the 2 layers by typing them in the User Layer 8 and 9 fields.
